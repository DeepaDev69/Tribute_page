                            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈæbdəl kəˈlɑːm/; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
                            aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in 
                            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and 
                            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
                            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development 
                            efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
                            vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II 
                            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                                    <li>2015: Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
                                        While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. 
                                        At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in 
                                        a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, 
                                        Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: 
                                        "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
